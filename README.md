# BioAider V1.0

---

## 1. Introduction
With the development of sequencing technology, a large amount of genomic sequenced datas has been accumulated. Analyzing these data will help us understand their genetic variation at the molecular level. However, processing a large-scale sequences is difficult for biological or clinical expert without bioinformatics and programming skills. Besides,  the needs are also diverse due to different research purposes. Therefore,  simplicity of operation and diversity of function are needed.


BioAider is developed  based on Python and R, which is a user-friendly GUI-interface program. As a desktop platform for genomic sequencing data studies, BioAider is designed to simplicity of operation and high summary of analysis results, which could save a lot of time for researchers. 

## 2. Download and install
BioAider V1.0 and all the updated versions is freely available for non-commercial user at [https://github.com/ZhijianZhou01/BioAider/releases](https://github.com/ZhijianZhou01/BioAider/releases). After obtaining the program, users  could directly run the program by clicking executable file without installing.


## 3. Example of functions
<b>Noteï¼š</b> The BioAider will be in long-term development and functional improvement. We only introduce some functional here, please refer to the instruction manual for details.
