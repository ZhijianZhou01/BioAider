## BioAider V1.529-beta (Feb 01, 2024)

### Add new functions

+ Add an extra output file in the <b>Combination nt and aa (nt/aa)</b> function of <b>Sequence Identity Matrix</b>, according to the user's proposed needs. The extra output data was used to draw heatmaps, below the diagonal is nucleotide identity and above diagonal is amino acid identity.

+ In the codon-based function, allow both base T and base U to exist in the input sequence-file, BioAider replaces all base U with base T before the calculation in these sections below,

  - The codon-alignment method based on MAFFT, Muscle and Clustal-Omega plugins.

  - The codon-based options in <b>Mutation Analysis</b>, <b>Sequence Identity Matrix</b> and <b>Sequence Vary</b> (nt â†’ aa translation).
  
  - <b>Tip</b>: still, we want you to import consistent sequences correctly.

+ Change the import method of MAFFT, Muscle, Clustal-Omega and FastTree plugins, the new version using the <b>Manage plugins</b> menu instead of requiring <b>external_program.zip</b>.

### Fix bugs
+ In the previous <b>Ambiguous Base Edition</b>, if there is not stop-codon at the end of the sequence, the last three bases will be deleted by mistake. This bug was fixed by the original contributors (Xiyue Wang). 

### Tip
+ This <b>automatic update prompt</b> will be turned off on February 28, 2024. If you do not need the above features, please continue to use V1.527.
