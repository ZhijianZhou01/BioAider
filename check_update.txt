(describer start)
## BioAider V1.527 (Feb 21, 2023)
### Add new functions

+ Provides tools for hierarchical clustering based on k-mer features of nucleotide sequence.

+ Added options for nucleotide, codon and amino acid in the Linked mode of <b>"Mutation Analysis"</b>. 

+ For codon data, add the output result in <b>"Mutation Analysis"</b> that can be used to draw mutant lollipops.

+ Support multiple opening of the same pop-up window to run multiple data at the same time.

+ Provides an <b>efficient electronic-lab-notebook</b> to support recording experiments and managing them.
  
+ Increase update detection of software version, including manual and automatic one.

+ Support changing font and font size of software.

+ Add codon-extraction function in <b>"Sequence Vary"</b>, including two modes, (1, 2 , 3) and (1 + 2, 3).

+ Support adding and deleting shortcuts, quickly access other software while using BioAider.

+ Provide graphical interfaces for some classic command-line  programs
  + Provide the graphical interfaces for [IQ-Tree](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/37/5/1530/5721363), [MrBayes](https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/index.html) and [ModelFinder](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4285) softwares, to make them easy to use. These tools are loaded as plugins at the user's choice in BioAider. Thanks to development teams of these classic softwares.
  + Added conversion tool of model parameter, and easily prepare model-files for IQ-Tree and MrBayes When the sequence data is partitioned.
  
  + Provide a graphical interface for [Blast](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2231712/). The Blast program is loaded as plugin at the user's choice in BioAider. Greatly simplify library construction and sequence alignment, and provide convenient management of multiple databases. Thanks to development team of Blast software.
